It's good to be proven right, to be vindicated. For me these moments are few and far between, so I remember the recent ones - especially because they brought about polar reactions.

The first time was after three months of fundraising, when the time came for me and my partner to decide on which of the offers on the table we should accept. We had about three real offers. One was about to explode, and a fourth was waiting on the wings in uncertainty. In what my partner calls the only real argument we've ever had (every couple has one, I was glad we got it out of the way), we ended up fighting for different offers. His side was the one that promised the better (and I agree with him, closer to real) valuation, but to me it was mired in difficulty. The lead was only willing to take a small part of the round, and while we had a lot of it filled up there was still much to go. I also knew that fundraising for three months as a small team had hurt our business dearly, and another six months (a reasonable estimate from the lead's prior investments) of due diligence and corralling a party round had a good chance of putting us dead in the water. My choice had a smaller valuation, but the lead was considerably more interested and invested in what we wanted to do, and us as people - it represented a shorter close, and more importantly it represented investors who were investing in you. I convinced him, and while the conversation lingered I found myself wondering if I'd ever know for sure if this was the right call, and if every outcome with the party of my choice would subconsciously be of my making to the both of us.

Against all odds, we found out for sure. A month into due-diligence, our second biggest investor (about 40% of the round) pulled out silently and without informing us for weeks, citing no reason and no ability for appeal. We found out from our lead, who told us in the same sentence that there was a change, and that they would be happy to cover the difference. Knowing for a fact that the other two offers we were seriously considering would have completely evaporated at needing to fill this allocation, I was proven right - and I was happy for being able to finally know.

The second was the day of closing our round. We had agreed terms with all investors and the paperwork was done, and we were meeting with the lead in the afternoon expecting to sign. It was a Monday, and that morning at breakfast I remember a collague congratulating us on closing. I'm not completely sure why, but I found myself involuntarily reminding him that nothing was done until it was done, and that there was many a slip between the cup and the lip.

I was right. We walked into a meeting with different expressions than we expected, where we were told the deal was buried with no chance of saving it, the primary reason being personal. I was right, but I did not want to be this time.

I co-founded [Greywing](https://grey-wing.com) six months ago, with the intention of building a SaaS-enabled marketplace for physical security. We secured some funding in pre-seed, built a product and took it to 130K total market volume in a month of release, and set about raising the next round with the intention of growing the company from where it stood. Beautiful start right out of the gate, and until the very last moment it looked easy and almost sure that we would lock it down. We didn't.

This is not a story of failure, but it contains many failings. Many of them mine, the majority of them unattributable - results of things we didn't know we didn't know, the emergent nature of human interaction, and just plain luck. We had over a hundred meetings, three term sheets, and one other offer for funding that wasn't a term sheet. What I'm hoping to do here is to provide an overview of what it was like, and in doing so put something out there that could have helped me, six months ago. I hope it helps you. Every market is different - and more visibility helps us all.

## What I know

I'll do this in reverse, so the most concrete parts are at the top. I'll cover what I think are [dos](#what-helps) and [donts](#what-hurts), then outline [what happened](#what-happened), followed by [the stats](#the-stats) of how our three months of raising went down. The american market often speaks the loudest, and sometimes that cand drown out cultural differences and the nuances of raising outside of Sand Hill road. I'll also try and mention a few things that [didn't quite match up to expectations](#not-always-true).

## What helped us

I'm sure none of the things below are new, but they were what we found the most useful, and concretely so.

#### 1. Regular updates

I cannot stress how much this helped. Investors are in a strange job, and this is especially true for seed investors. An early stage investor is often approached without a product, with no real traction, a few founders and an idea. This is the worst place to start from - because this early, the idea matters 1% if that; execution and the team is everything. We were ahead of the pack: we had strong traction, a good team with deep expertise in tech and our domain, strong financials, and a completed product. Despite this, I'd estimate about 40% of our meetings would not email us back until we sent them an update. Every week, we would send an update and watch as replies came in within the hour.

Understandably so. You know you work hard and move things, but it looks very quiet from the outside unless you say something. A regular update (much like the one your mom keeps asking for) lets someone look in and see a company in motion, of founders at work. It also provides them with more data to assess you past the initial pitch - and this is data you want to give. Even if some of it doesn't impress, it still shows tenacity and paints you as human being willing to learn from your mistakes. No one expects founders (or anyone) to make all the right moves; often the question of what you will do when you make the wrong move is far more important.

[picture of update]

In our update emails, we have X subheadings (in reverse order): What we did last week, what we expect to do next week, bad news, and good news. We tried to keep them brief, but if we had a lot to say we sometimes subdivided them into business, tech and fundraising. That last one was us going out on a limb, but it preempted questions we answered in person anyway, and definitely explained where our time went when we were spending a good chunk of it on meetings. Setting the goals (which are ideally small and not too lofty) allowed us to look ahead, and look behind each week to see what we couldn't do and why.

Sending the emails also had the benefit of helping us find the right investors. The old saying is "if you want money, ask for advice. If you want advice, ask for money", and it's been true in a lot of our meetings. That said, very few of the people we spoke to took the time to look into the specifics of the company, to think it through and offer operational advice. Those that did are still people we turn to for advice, investors or not.

So, updates - absolutely. Send one out even if you're both going on vacation - just say that. Way, way better than saying nothing, which is still better than only showing up to ask for money.

#### 2. Know when not to fluff

The inverse is also true. Pitch inflation is a real thing, and one that we fought tooth and nail, but perhaps lost a few times. If the market is used to inflated decks that promise big data before having 20 rows in a database, or AI on everything and multi-billion dollar carve-outs, it is incredibly hard to be honest and stick to what you believe. If everyone knocks 80% off of what you're saying to get to the truth, not inflating can be a problem. What worked for us was pitching up, but being honest. "Data? Yes, that's a potential use case and here's our modelling, but none of this works unless we can get the existing industry to be digital in the first place; we're not looking at analytics for at least a year."

Having heard investors in Singapore talk in private about these things, stay off the format of the pitch deck once you're past the initial meeting. Formats are important the same way some design standards and guidelines are important - they save time by letting your brain know where to look. It's a little boring, but reinventing the playbook isn't always helpful. Once you're through the looking glass, be ready with more information, anticipate follow-ups and have something ready, and expect to use the initial deck at best as a map to other things.

#### 3.<a name="do-3"></a> Do the math yourself

Some things make you feel like an idiot for not having thought of them before. Looking at our financials like an investor was one of those. Of course, I wouldn't advise building up to it other than how we did - we looked at the things we wanted to do, our assumptions about the market, our expected burn, and forecasted where we would be. What we did not do was to try and look at it from the other side. If we did, we would not only have the reasonable financial forecast we did, we would also have the best case and worst case scenarios of our market assumptions. We would also have known what kind of ROI we were promising in these scenarios. It was there, and we knew how to do it, we just didn't until we were asked.

## What hurt us

Again, take these with a pinch of salt and know that while nothing is new under the sun, everything has a long tail where it will fail to hold. That said, these were some mental and occupational traps I'd advise steering clear of.

#### 1. Forecasts are nothing more than forecasts

[Point 3](#do-3) above asks you to do a few things investors would do, but I would be wary of letting investors or yourself believe it too much. [The only thing you know about projections this early is that they are wrong]. Don't fall into the trap of valuing your company with money you don't have yet, and holding on to things that have no defined worth yet. A little might be okay, but if you believe in your future with double digit precision, you've gone off the reservation - so keep the people who read your forecasts from falling into the same pit.

So why do it? A detailed forecast lets you write down, in concrete form - your assumptions. Even things you didn't know were assumptions. I can say with almost complete conviction that you will be wrong on every count. You'll either undershoot or overshoot your expectations. Which direction and by how much will let you reevaluate what made you think the way you did in the past. For an early stage company, it's valuable journaling.

For investors, it lets them evaluate your knowledge of the market that they expect you to master, and see how ambitious you are. It's more data. So definitely do it, but don't worry about buying new clothes your first day at the gym.

#### 2. Everything is useful, especially a no

This is something I tell myself over and over again, because I find myself in category of people that take a no to heart more than I know I should. It feels like a rejection - which it is, just not of everything - and evokes a desire to move on. Don't. Stay in the no, because it's just as valuable as a yes. For starters, a no is usually just a specific no. Find out what else is on offer - it could be advice, it could be a relationship, or it could be a yes way down the line. Some of the pivotal moments of this company came from nos, and not from the rejections they implied. For another, find out why - especially if you hate a no. Finally, if you're not convinced yet here's a more superficial reason: sticking around after a no makes you look like a better person who can handle rejection, who won't bolt at the first sign on trouble.

#### 3. Spend cheques that haven't cleared

This is the one that didn't hurt us. This is the one thing we emphasized despite our better instincts, and it is what ended up saving us. I don't mean in the obvious way - most of the founders I know are smart enough not to spend money they don't have, at least on the broad strokes. They hold off on getting the office, or before raising payroll. They keep an eye on the burn.

What is a lot harder is trying to curb lifestyle inflation as a company when you're finalising paperwork on a done deal. New CRM that's $50 a user a month? No problem. Conference visits? We could probably cover that with existing revenue. New SaaS subscriptions for development, and more staging servers while we're at it? No problem. None of these individually pose a threat, but taken together they can leave a company dead or bleeding out of a thousand cuts. What I've relearned through this process is to plan like the company you intend to build, but spend like the company you are, at least until you actually have what you intend to spend.

I have to point out that I might be recently biased - confirmation bias combined with the fact that we are the posterchild for 'shit happens'. None of the easily foreseen problems really affected us, but we had setbacks we simply didn't expect, always at the last minute, and always completely unexpected.

## Shit does happen

You've already heard the pivotal points of the story, but I must mention that there is absolutely no ill will towards any of the parties mentioned. We're all making the calls we think are the best for ourselves and our concerns, and the margin of error at estimating the future of a company this early are way too high for any call to be right or wrong yet. Most everything at this stage is just conjecture. For every investor we met, we learned something, and I can honestly say that Greywing is a better company today as a result.

We're still alive and healthy, if a little worse for the wear of fundraising. We're looking at 2020 to be the year that proves us right or wrong that we can do this. If we're wrong, I tip my hat to those that saw it before me. If we're right, we'll be a stronger company for having done it this way. We're looking forward.

## The stats

[Chart]

Here's a small breakdown of what happened. We contacted X VCs, got a first meeting with X of them, a second with X, offers from X, and accepted one offer with X other investors taking smaller investments of the round. This is all anecdotal and focused on a single company and a single market, but hopefully this is useful to someone else.

## Not always true

As a prologue, here's something I was told to expect, but that I encountered exceptions to more than the default:

Nothing is standard - A lot of the early advice around the termsheet and the structure of a deal will tell you that "standard provisions" are a negotiating ploy, an easy way to get you to agree to something you don't want to. It's also easy to believe, and I did and still do - to an extent. It's very often true. However, allow me to present some of the times you want to believe it, at the risk of confusing you. Sometimes, changing standard terms involves more work, which either party may not view as being worth it. Some other times, especially in with multiple rounds ahead, this puts the current round in the position of worrying that the next round will reset to standard terms. This is bad, especially if the terms change in a way that is unfavorable to current investors. If you can, know why you're getting pushback - cultivate your own relationships that can help. Even if you don't, try to understand the kind of situation you're in - can you trade something for another? is this is a test of strength? are you talking to the right person? Knowing more is always better of course - but sometimes knowing the right questions can help.
