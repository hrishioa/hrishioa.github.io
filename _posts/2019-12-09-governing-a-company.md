The successful modern company is not that different from a schizofrenic frontier man. For some time now, I have been trying my best not to confront this idea and its consequences. Yet, as time goes on I am increasingly convinced of a few things.

One, that a company has no purpose by design and no easy means to find one. Second, that this lack of purpose eventually defaults to the same one we find in ourselves: a desire to exist to continue an existence.
These in themselves - if true - aren't disastrous, if not for the next two conclusions.
<!-- he could really give me more massages couldnt he. hmm such feedback -->

Third, that the first two, in a modern context, lead to the intentional obfuscation of communication to the stakeholders of a business. Fourth, that
Fourth, that such a successful company ends up in direct conflict with the structures of our society. Both of these can lead to horrible consequences, and I believe we're beginning to see their effects.


This essay is my attempt at challenging myself to give opposable form to these arguments, and in writing them attempt to have myself proven wrong - because I genuinely hope I am.
If I'm not, I attempt to provide an alternative, to be challenged by the reader, partly as an exercise and partly due to my fatigue with alarmists who never attempt a solution.

## A reason for existence

Most businesses today can't seem to make up their minds about their raison d'etre. Who do they serve?

The core of capitalist belief would tell us that this beneficiary is the consumer. Yet the management and speculative traders (I'm grouping them together since their compensations are often tied to the same thing) of a company's assets would believe the beneficiary to be themselves. The employees and their unions, along with a number of political parties would disagree, and the investors would
strongly believe it to be themselves.

If it's lucky, the company has a long term vision or some person of magnitude as a substitute, that hasn't been eroded yet.
Hopefully it's not some Barnum statement like "Don't Be Evil" (you would think those would hold up and not piss anybody off, but even they seem to eventually weather themselves into nothing). If it's unlucky, it sells some intangible service or brokers some deal helping one company sell to another, whose customers it will never meet.

This confusion isn't merely theoretical. It pervades the businesses we see around us.
<!-- what results? if you've seen them firsthand, a concrete example pulled from experience would help substantiate -->
I've seen firsthand the results of this lack of a truly defensible benefactor at the companies I have observed - and while I hope things are different
<!-- different how? -->
elsewhere, I can't find many reasons that they would be.

This is not to say that a lack of purpose is a showstopping problem within a company. In fact when things are good, it's barely a problem. In times of plenty, this confusion in goals simply expresses itself as a desire to "do better", without much thought to the specifics - it's what mission and vision statements are made of. PR teams eat this stuff for breakfast. When things are good, it isn't hard to imagine that the company can benefit everyone, forever, if it only did more and did it better - ad infinitum.

When things are bad, this confusion becomes a power struggle. This struggle for purpose is expressed by lawyers, trying to figure out who has the clout to decide the new direction. It is not surprising that the ultimate direction will often directly benefit whichever authority makes the decision (particularly humorous is a [study] finding that [X] percent of companies who changed their headquarters moved closer to the CEO's house). This is understandable - the new authority, when faced with a lack of surety will usually fall back on the tried and tested maxims of personal benefit or making money. It's the business version of "no one ever got fired for buying AWS".

## Imago Dei

So it is that when faced with hard times - either from having failed at a goal or from having [succeeded too well at it](https://www.google.com) - companies will move themselves to align with either survival or growth, respectively. Survival without any other purpose. Growth, not as a metric but as a target. Once this happens, avoiding a steady state or death (sometimes equated) is the only thing that drives this machine forward. Again, this is understandable - it is the fundamental driver of a human being in the new world. Is it a surprise that the things we make, we make in our image?

Understandable, but not condonable. As in our own lives, this is not an acceptable purpose because it brings with it all the aimlessness and vagaries of ourselves. It becomes especially dangerous in an entity that has no mind but the collective, no singular will but many, yet is imbued by us with power that can affect the world we live in.

## Hard to describe

If this was the only state of affairs and we were willing to accept it, we might still be okay. But along come employees, who want to know what they're working for, governments who want to know what they're doing, consumers who want to be a part of something they believe in, and this starts the painful process  of obfuscation (which today supports a billion dollar industry).

[Mad Men]

Companies today are purposefully vague in the things they believe in - a modern executive might be laughed out of the room for trying to write down his vision for the company without help from the lawyers or the PR department. They're often right to do so - if the underlying purpose is growth or survival, any prevarication about something else will include a risk of harming or revealing (sometimes the same thing) what lies beneath the words.

This works, but only a little and no further. To me, this is why the modern company is made of multiple entities dealing to themselves, holding companies, shell companies, and shelf companies. It's why the modern worker feels like every job is just a path to a better resume. PR is usually an arms race to stay ahead of people's bullshit detectors.

So we get ambling [cronenbergs] that don't know who they are or where they're going; just that they need to make money. No idea why, not sure how much is enough, just "more than last quarter". Once this filters into the lower ranks, employees start counting vacation days. Management eventually passes some tiny piece of the company down as [an option], hoping it'll unite everyone in a common goal, only there was no goal set in the first place. If this works - and it is a big if - all it does is cement the purpose as "making more money", or "raising the stock price". The latter is particularly bad, because the stock market doesn't encourage long term thinking.

## Angry goliaths

Now what does a company want to be when it grows up? Most often, it goes to bed dreaming of being multinational, of large offices filled with many employees, soaring stock prices, expanding and diversifying into new verticals, keeping costs low. It definitely wants to be digital, virtual, so thin it doesn't exist.

Yet the companies that achieve this look to be in an unenviable position, with the most successful often having to fight on many fronts. To be a successful multinational company - especially a technology company - is to be a stateless citizen, taxed by all, beholden to many, yet without true representation in any. So they serve to be more inscrutable, further complicating the job of figuring out why they exist - by design. Somewhere along the way they truly forget themselves and believe the empty hogwash they've been sending out.

This is a bad combination. It hasn't completely blown up on us yet - these companies used to work themselves into irrelevancy and turn into consultancy   shops or OEMs, then eventually be blown up by some [LBO] firm whose true and unshakeable purpose was making money. That, or they'd die from the thousand cuts inflicted on them by regulations, AI and terrible managers. A lot of bad things happened then - some people would lose their jobs, good engineering ideas would never see the light of day, the direct consumer would get a raw deal - but it was something we could move on from as a society. Hell, we've practically written it into the modern creed of capitalism: the urge to destroy is a creative urge.

[Cosmopolis]

That was before we had companies too big to fail and loaded up with way too much fuel. These modern Goliaths contain enough power, money and knowledge that we should all be afraid if it starts looking like they don't know why they're alive. Inequality and concentration of wealth is a problem, but this powerful aimlessless is the  one that really keeps me up at night. I fear the modern corporation will someday look around and wonder why it listens to all these people who know a lot less and have a lot less than it does. That would be a bad day. The elephant tamer only succeeds because the elephant thinks he can hurt it. If things don't change, some day, I fear a revolt of the corporations might come upon us.

So this is why I worry when Zuck gets called up in Congress, global anger against corporations is rising, and I see [talk of building city-states](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-20/silicon-valley-seasteaders-go-looking-for-low-tax-sites-on-land) again.

## How did we get here?

We are in this situation partly because of The [Invisible] [Hand]. By assigning the forces that shape our world to an emergent force and encapsulating it in institutions that are forced to take will and make decisions without a guiding core, this status quo looks predictable in retrospect.
Office Space practically writes itself. By capturing "the way of doing business" in an entity and allowing it to borrow money, own things and change the lives of human beings, we've created a dangerous cocktail. Giving an emergent, unknown force personhood (or near-personhood) is worrying.

Before I try and suggest an alternative, I should say that I don't blame the money, or the numbers. It's easy to get mad at risk adjusted returns and discounted cashflows and sharpe ratios, but they've always just been tools and indicators to answer questions.
They've always been metrics, and somehow we forget Amdahl's Law again - [when a measure becomes a target, it stops being a good measure].

And while we're talking about blame, I can't remember when we started blaming companies for things. A company at some point was a holding entity - holding *what* I'm still not truly sure - but not one with a consciousness, not one capable of making decisions or understanding them. Today, we're happy to blame companies for anything, and we use them in conversation as if they willed and moved on their own. They really don't - and if they did I would be amazed to watch one. They're mostly stacks of paper filed in triplicate that serve to control and direct action, not engender it. Not to say that there aren't emergent forces and pseudo-actions that arise out of the interactions of people and have a real effect on the world, but having them be inscrutable by design serves to make them truly dangerous.

## What can be done?

It seems to me that we need a better definition for a company. Let's try this with first principles - if such a structure needs to exist, it must have a reason.

I'm a person that wants to do something, and I can borrow money to fund my operations.
All good, unless there's five of us, and we have a common goal (and perhaps no collateral but our dreams). Then we'd like to borrow against future returns, and hold liable the proceeds *of that goal*. I'd like to be protected as an individual past a point, and I'd also like the goal to stand on its own value - which may be greater than the sum of its people. Why don't we call this **a cooperation**. Not a typo, just an easier way for me to separate what I'm suggesting from what exists. The goal here is what united us, and the goal is what you evaluate when you evaluate this cooperation.

A lot goes on top - we can make rules about how that goal is achieved, who has operational authority, who gets what share of the profits, etc. But notice how it's still easy to look at this cooperation and understand it. It's Will, Matt and John and they're trying to make a search engine. That's it.

We're still in company land today, so my proposal is this: it should be impossible for a company to exist without a common goal, and the common goal must identify the company above all else. If must know in advance what to do if it achieves or fails at this goal - it can return the proceeds to those involved, [reincooperate] itself with a new goal, but its goal **must not be** only to survive in perpetuity, regardless of the goal.

This isn't completely radical. Some of my favorite companies were united in a singular vision or arose out of teams that had one goal - and quickly devolved into [Initech] once that vision was achieved. Most of them used a person or few to hold together this vision - which works, but only as much as an authoritarian form of government. What does your cult of personality do when the person moves on or dies? You amble on. You get a mercenary CEO, who will trim some fat and focus on your profit centers, and the best case scenario at that point becomes that you're a company that makes money. The means becomes less and less important every day, and I hope I've provided some examples to why the means are important.

<!-- confusion between 'action' and 'goal' in subsequent para. Which is a company meant to represent? -->
We decide to only accept two base types (and variations) of entites in our world, both atomic. One is a person - standard issue human being and [any rivers or trees](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/2019/04/maori-river-in-new-zealand-is-a-legal-person/) you want to induct into it. The other is an action stated as a goal. A company (or cooperation) then becomes the vehicle by which this action can borrow money, own assets and do other things - in service of that goal. A person is allowed to operate on self-interest - his pursuit of happiness - but a cooperation has no self-interest other than its purpose. It cannot feel happiness, it cannot feel pain, but it can cause both of those things, which makes it dangerous to treat it as if it had free will. It really doesn't. At best it is an emergent entity, but not one with free will.

We also get more efficient markets - a failed idea, but a good aspiration. We are now better able to judge the value of a cooperation, through the results of its actions in service of its goal. An acquisition doesn't make you more valuable unless it serves the common goal. You don't get additional value because someone sold you to himself for more money. You're more valuable the closer you get to what you want to do.

## Why write this?

Every day is the day I find out I've been wrong about something, and these are often the most meaningful moments of my life. If you do not agree, consider me ranting from my front porch to those passing by, as a way of finding out what I think I'm thinking about. I sincerely hope you tell me why though. If nothing else, this is something I can read in some time and remember why I was wrong.

Maybe this has all been said before, but I needed to hear it. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe this is the best epoch of all the ones we've made and we're on the right track. I worry that we're not. I worry that we'll end up back in the land of samurai, with bandit companies fending their territory with armed virtual militia - I'm kidding, I'm kidding. But I do worry that the modern company cannot exist without a definition much longer.
