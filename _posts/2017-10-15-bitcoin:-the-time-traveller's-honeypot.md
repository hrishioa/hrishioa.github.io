Open with the Legend of John Kevorkian



If you were a time traveller, what's the first thing you'd do? See the last mammoths? Watch the last pyramid get built? Watch the first pyramid get built? I'd probably do something like this



## Scratchpad

* Bitcoin is a time traveller's honeypot
* History
  * Intellectual Exercise: If you were a time traveller, what would you do?
    * History
      * Need power, if you believe in self-preservation
        * Money/Status
          * Gain
    * Gain
    * Experience
  * Ideas
    * "Go back to ancient Egypt and be an oracle"
    * "Go predict 2008"
* So, gain. What characteristics are we looking for then?
  * Minimum risk
  * Maximum upside
  * Low capital requirements
* Compare a few proposed scenarios
  * Predict 2008
  * Go back to the gold rush
  * Go back and invent the iPod
* Conclusion
* How could we look for them
  * John Kevorkian
  * Prescient Individuals
    * Buy and sell at the right moments
      * With some random mixing of course
      * Not a true random walk
      * "Lost" private keys as deposits for the future
      * Irregular patterns
* Overall - just interesting. Or just being autobiographical.
